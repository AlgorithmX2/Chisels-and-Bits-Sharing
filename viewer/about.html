<h1>Chisels &amp; Bits Viewer - Work in Progress</h1>

<p>In the future I'll be adding the ability to export designs that can be shared online or simply saved for future use. At first I thought it would be neat if they were bundled with a screen shot of whats being shared so that everyone can see your creations<p>

<p>It occurred to me that screen shots often don't really do some of these creations justice, so I came up with the idea to render the shared models as 3d models in the browser for everyone to checkout in their full detail, regardless of the time of day, or angle of the screen shot.</p>

<p>This is the alpha of that project, all the models viewed here are generated from real in world game data and provided here as a demonstration.</p>

<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>

<h4>TLDR</h4>
<p>This is a WIP renderer to visualize 3D builds that can be shared outside of the game.</p>

<h4>Wheres the model stored?</h4>
